# Assignment for the quicksell frontend role 

> !Note: This assignment code is in `https://github.com/Gmin2/quicksell-assign and deployed in https://quicksell-assign-six.vercel.app/`

Apart from the instruction given in the assignment (image, not the requirements, have done requirements same as it is), I have done few things differently 

- Done this assignment in TypeScript

- I have generated names and email from list of my friends instead of just hardcoding to John Doe as given in the assignment screenshot

- Have broken down into three components (CustomerList, CustomerHeader, CustomerRow) 

- For the user avatar I have used DiceBear API to generate a random avatar from the name of the customer 

- I have used Lucid Icons for arrow Icons to sort the column in asc or desc order

- I have used sans serif fonts
